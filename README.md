Quake 4 Plants vs. Zombies Inspired Mod
----------------------------------------
This mod was intended to be a PvZ-inspired tower defense game that utilized a grid system to defend from an unspecified
number of zombie waves. The player has 4 lanes with 6 cells in each to place towers and other fortifications. If the
zombies reached the end of all 4 lanes, the player would lose. 

How to Play: 
- Use initial deposit of 1000 currency to buy towers and place them on the grid
- Obtain more currency by eliminating incoming zombies. You cannot build a tower if the cell is
  occupied or if you do not have enough currency.
- Killing zombies may drop a one-time-use powerup which is used automatically upon pickup.
- Lanes are knocked out if a zombie kills the marine at the end of the lane.
- The player loses when all lanes are knocked out.
- Defend your marines using the towers. Last as long as you can.

Controls:
-= Arrow Keys, Enter, Backspace =-
- Manipulate the grid selectors using the arrow key
- Press 'Enter' to select the highlighted cell, press 'Backspace' to cancel selection
- If the cell is empty, press 1-0 to select a tower to be built on that cell
    - Pressing 1-0 without selecting a cell provides that tower's cost and short description
- Pick up powerups by moving the cursor to their position and pressing 'Enter'
- Sell towers by selecting the cell that the tower is on and pressing 'Enter'

Project Deliverables:
- 10 different kinds of towers
- 5 unique enemy zombies
- In-game economy management/buy menu
+ 4 lanes/lane mechanics (Tower placement, enemy movement, lane elimination, etc.)
- 5 different one time use powerups (to be placed by the player)
